# Deep Learning Development Excercises & Projects

## Description
This repo is a home for exercises and projects in Deep Learning as I prepare to take the TensorFlow Certified Developer Exam. This includes exercises and projects associated with the following online Courses.

- [Tensorflow Developer Certificate in 2023: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/)
- [The Complete Neural Networks Bootcamp: Theory, Applications](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-neural-networks-bootcamp-theory-applications/)

Overall, the primary purpose of this repo is to build out my skill set in deep learning above and beyond what is required of the TensorFlow Developer exam. The purpose of me taking the exam is to showcase my knowledge in deep learning through a reputable source.

## Exercises
The main purpose of this notebook is to house my work as I learn about deep learning and TensorFlow. This includes notebooks dedicated to learning specific areas of study in Deep learning. The list below summarizes the various excerices done during this process.

1. Numpy Fundamentals
2. Pandas Fundamentals
3. TensorFlow Fundamentals
4. Introduction to Neural Network Regression
5. Introduction to Neural Network Classification
6. Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
7. Introduction to Transfer Learning
8. Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks


## Projects
A major part of fully understanding Deep Learning is putting it to real-world problems and seeing how it works. To do this, I worked on a handful of projects to dive into various areas of deep learning such as image classification, language models, and timeseries models. The list below gives a brief title and summary of what each project includes.

1. Medical Insurance Cost
   * Deep learning project to understand regression problems using Neural Networks through predicting the price of medical insurance from a dataset on personal information.
2. Clothing Image Classification
    * Deep learning project to understand classification problems using Neural Networks by classifying images as types of clothing (Note that this is not a CNN notebook).
3. Food Vision
    * Project dedicated to learning Convultional Neural Networks through the analysis of the Food-101 dataset.
4. Skim Lit
    * Project dedicated to learning Recurrent Neural Networks through the analysis of medical research abstracts and classifying the segment as what the section describes.
5. Bit Predict
    * Project dedicated to learning and modeling timeseries datasets, through using historical Bit Coin prices to predict the price of bit coin.

## Additional Work
This is an ongoing repository for the prepartion of the TensorFlow Exam.

**NOTE** The `src` directory has been fully depricated in favor of my other repository, [py-learning-toolbox](https://github.com/bkubick/py-learning-toolbox), which will be the home for all of my reusable utilities for deep learning projects.

1. Create a notebook dedicated to the TensorFlow exam and include notes.
2. Add additional experiments to the `Food Vision` project.
3. Dive deeper into customization, such as custom models, layers, loss functions, etc.
4. Create another timeseries project in conjunction with my `algorithmic-trading` repo, to attempt to predict stock prices for certain companies.
5. Create another large-language project.
6. Create another Feed-forward project to predict real estate prices.
