# Deep Learning Development Excercises & Projects

## Description
This repo consists of exercises and projects in Deep Learning to be a home for my work as I prepare to take the TensorFlow Certified Developer Exam.

This includes exercises and projects associated with the following online Courses.
- [Tensorflow Developer Certificate in 2023: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/)
- [The Complete Neural Networks Bootcamp: Theory, Applications](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-neural-networks-bootcamp-theory-applications/)

## Exercises
The main purpose of this notebook is to house my work as I learn about deep learning and TensorFlow. This includes notebooks dedicated to learning specific areas of study in Deep learning. The list below summarizes the various excerices done during this process.

1. Numpy Fundamentals
2. Pandas Fundamentals
3. TensorFlow Fundamentals
4. Introduction to Neural Network Regression
5. Introduction to Neural Network Classification
6. Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
7. Introduction to Transfer Learning
8. Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks


## Projects
A major part of fully understanding Deep Learning is putting it to real-world problems and seeing how it works. To do this, I worked on a handful of projects to dive into various areas of deep learning such as image classification, language models, and timeseries models. The list below gives a brief title and summary of what each project includes.

1. Medical Insurance Cost
   * Deep learning project to understand regression problems using Neural Networks through predicting the price of medical insurance from a dataset on personal information.
2. Clothing Image Classification
    * Deep learning project to understand classification problems using Neural Networks by classifying images as types of clothing (Note that this is not a CNN notebook).
3. Food Classification Notebook to be Added Soon!
4. Skim Lit
    * Project dedicated to learning Recurrent Neural Networks through the analysis of medical research abstracts and classifying the segment as what the section describes.
5. Bit Predict
    * Project dedicated to learning and modeling timeseries datasets, through using historical Bit Coin prices to predict the price of bit coin.

## Additional Work
This is an ongoing repository for the prepartion of the TensorFlow Exam.

**NOTE** The `src` directory is being fully depricated in favor of my other repository, [py-learning-toolbox](https://github.com/bkubick/py-learning-toolbox), which will be the home for all of my reusable utilities for deep learning projects.

1. Cleanup all excercise notebooks to ensure they are all organized and go into detail regarding each section.
2. Fully deprecate the `src` folder per my note above.
3. Move my Food classifier notebook from Google Colab to this repository.
4. Create a notebook dedicated to the TensorFlow exam and include notes.
